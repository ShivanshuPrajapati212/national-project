# School ERP & Network

Communication within a school is often chaotic and fragmented.
Important announcements are stuck on physical notice boards where no one looks, 
exam schedules get lost in random WhatsApp groups, and students lack a safe,
centralized platform to showcase their talent or ask for help.
Create a unified "School Network" platform that acts as the school's official social network, exam planner, and resource center.
